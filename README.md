# REAL-TIME-HAND-DRAWN-PATTERN-RECOGNITION-BASED-ON-HAND-GESTURES

**Introduction**

The REAL-TIME-HAND-DRAWN-PATTERN-RECOGNITION-BASED-ON-HAND-GESTURES is an advanced project designed to tackle mathematical problems using cutting-edge technology. By leveraging Computer Vision through OpenCV and Generative AI via Google's Gemini AI, this calculator allows users to draw mathematical expressions directly on the screen. The AI model interprets these visual inputs to deliver accurate and detailed solutions, making complex calculations intuitive and accessible. Inspired by the functionality of the Apple iPad calculator, this project enhances user experience with sophisticated AI capabilities, providing both precision and ease of use.
